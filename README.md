# Supplier Quote Analyzer Tool
Tools to analyze supplier quotes.

I normally build with a colleague and they put it on their github. This time I want to also build my portfolio.
## Projects
- `supplier_quote_analyzer.py`:
- This tool compares two supplier quotes in a PDF format. It looks at price, delivery, payment terms, warranty, and shipping cost.
- It scores each supplier quoation and then flags potential issues.
- Then it finally selects the best supplier quotation. ;)

## Setup
1. Install Python 3.13: [Download from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - During installation, check "Add Python to PATH".
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
